    chmod 455 myteam

15. cd /home/andrew/myteam         
                            > this command wouldnt work because although myteam have an excute 
                            permision for other users the home dir of andrew gives permission
                            to the owner only so i cant  enter the user home dir to go to myteam
                            folder
16. chmod 631 oldpasswd
    chmod g-r+wx,o-r+x oldpasswd                    
                         //if the file is created with the default permisions which is -rwr--r--
    umask 146
    the default for a file: u=rw g=r o=r
    the default for a directory: u=rwx g=xr o=x
    umask777

17.source dir: u=r    target dir: u=wx
   file : u=r         target dir: u=wx
   you dont need any permissions to delete a file
   to cd to a dir : u=x
   to ls a dir: u=r
   to view file content : u=r
   to modify file content: u=rw
18.i tried to read the and edit the file through vi , the reading worked but i couldnt edit
   i was able to succesfully remove the file though
19.excute permission in a file means that you can run the executable file while in a directory
    you have to have excute permisions to change to the dir and use ls -l commands
