2.  >`cat` display concatinated files contents For example if we try the command
    "cat /etc/passwd" it would display the content of all the files in /etc/passwd
    >`more` it does the same function as cat but instead of displaying all the content in one go
    it displays the content one screen at a time allowing the user to scroll throught the content

3.  >`rmdir` remove an empty directory
    >`rm`    can be used to remove a file , -r options removes the directory Recursively meaning 
    that both files and folders are removed
    -i prompts a conformation msg for deleting the file
    -f never prompt conformation
4.  > mkdir -p  dir1/dir11 && touch file1 && cd dir1 && mkdir dir12
    >mkdir docs && cd docs && touch mycv
    a.rm -r dir11
    b.rm -r dir12
    the heirarchy is now dir1 only
    c./home/andrew/docs/mycv   <Absloute path>
      docs                     <Relative Path>
