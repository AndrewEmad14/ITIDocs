date start from sundaty and ends at saturday

getyear vs getfull year

functions are objcts 

hello + undefined = helloundefined



from creates a new array with the elements of the array passes shallow copied


array.from() //shallow copy values and returns a new array

zzz=300 //global variable

if while for isnt considered scope
var z = 10;
var z. // this is nt an update z is equal to 10

hoisting only happens to var
