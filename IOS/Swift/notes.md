# SWIFT NOTES

    you must type with equal spacing between right and left hand side
    x =5                    X WRONG COMPILER ERROR

    x = 5                   CORRECT

# variables

    you use (var) for a variable
    you use (let) for a constant

    A constant or variable must have the same type as the value you want to assign to it
    However there is type infrence

    var x = 5

    var y = "string"

    if you want to explicitly specify the type you do it like this

    var:Int = 5

    if you try to input

# Datatype

    swift is also a strongly typed language
    if you want to cast you can do it like this

    var:int x
    x = Int(10.5)
    remeber that casting  int or double to string returns optional

    operation wont work without casting too
    let x = 5
    let y = 5.5
    let z = x + y

    if you want to include a variable in a string
    var label = 5.5
    let mystr = "Hello\(label)"


    swift does not have primitve types , instead each data type is in a struct

# String

# Optional
