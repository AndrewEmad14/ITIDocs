>BEWARE OF OVERFLOWS
            overflows are logical error that appears in runtime
                                ex: unsigned char a=-12;

                                char y = -x; //y=-x is syntaxly correct
                                the overflow is a circle when it overflows it over flows to the
                                next extreme
                                for (int i=8;i>;i--){
                                    printf("Welcome \n");
                                    if( i == 0){
                                        break;
                                    }
                                }

# FAQ
Lenter?
an equation that turns any number into the 
why is break hated

if(1){

}
printf("welcome")
else{

}

the else cant find its if

printf();;  //compiler error becuase printf expects an argument


c++ lab
file{
    function(x,y){}
    textcolor{} --done
    sleep()     --done
    clear()     --done

    check for both windows and linux
