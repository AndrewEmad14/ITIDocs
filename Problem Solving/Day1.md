# Passing variables to function

        pass by value : the variable in the function wont affect the orginal varible
                        bad for time and space complexity

        pass by refrence: the varibale in the function directly affect the varible
                            alias on the function

        pass by pointer: same as refrecne but pointer in the function

        pass by constant refrence: same as refrence but it is constant meaning it cant be changed in the fucntion

climbing stairs(premutations)

given a n number stairs calculate the ways to climb it 


when know the answer for a problem dont jump to implementation , convey your idea with the
interviewer


think of the brute force first

dont aim for the optimal soloution but the way of thinking that lead you to that solution
