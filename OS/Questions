PROCESS SCHEDULING ALGORITHMS
Average waiting time: (Avg WT)
Waiting time = Starting time – Arrival time
Avg WT = Total WT of all processes / No of processes
Average turn around time: (Avg TAT)
Turn around time = Finished time – Arrival time
Avg TAT= Total TAT of all processes / No of processes
Average response time: (Avg RT)
Response time = First response – Arrival time
Avg RT= Total RT of all processes / No of processes


preempted: process get paused while it is working
non preempted: process isnt paused

First come first server

shortest job first

Priority


Round robin

When dealing with round robin
arriving time equal Finishtime when the process is preempted and back again
