PROCESS SCHEDULING ALGORITHMS
Average waiting time: (Avg WT)
Waiting time = Starting time – Arrival time
Avg WT = Total WT of all processes / No of processes
Average turn around time: (Avg TAT)
Turn around time = Finished time – Arrival time
Avg TAT= Total TAT of all processes / No of processes
Average response time: (Avg RT)
Response time = First response – Arrival time
Avg RT= Total RT of all processes / No of processes


preempted: process get paused while it is working
non preempted: process isnt paused

First come first server

shortest job first

Priority


Round robin

When dealing with round robin
arriving time equal Finishtime when the process is preempted and back again


preemtimve SJF is called shortest remaing time SCHEDULING
Address binding: the process of mapping an address space with another address space

Rollout Roll in:  swapping technique for freeing up memory temporarily
in order to perform another task.The current program or program segment is stored
(rolled out) on disk,and another program is brought into (rolled in) that memory space.

Meomory Management Unit: The runtime mapping form virtual to physical address

Priority is caluclated accesndingly
