    deadlock happends when a process has a shared rescource and is locked while another process has a shared recource but each other need the others recourse to complete its execution

>4 condition for dead lock
    -Mutal exclusion
    -Hold and wait
    -no preemption
    -circular wait
>how to solve deadlock
    -Geneocide : kill all process
    -kill process by process until the deadlock is solved
    -let the user decide

# Contigous allocation
>External Fragmantation issue
            holes in the meomory and the process must have a adjacent memory in order to go to
we can solve it with compaction
>Internal Framgmentation
            after dividing our meomory into frames and pages there will be holes in the frame but those wholes cant be filled by another application unlike external fragmentation

# frames and pages
        >memory is divided into frames and frames are divided into pages
        >meomry now doesnt have to be sequential
        >it is divided into pages and a page table to manges it

# Segmentation
        >compiler divides the code into segemants
        >some OS uses segmeants and frames
