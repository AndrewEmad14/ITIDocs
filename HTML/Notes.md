The better practice is:

Use <div> when you're creating a container/layout element (even if it's flexbox)
Use <span> for inline text styling within a sentence


When to use IDs:

When you need to target something with JavaScript
For unique page landmarks (like #main-content)
For form label associations

For styling alone, classes are almost always better!
